## Key Components

### 1. **Supabase Client**

The Supabase client is configured in `lib/supabase.ts`:

```typescript
import { createClient } from "@supabase/supabase-js";
import AsyncStorage from "@react-native-async-storage/async-storage";
import { Platform } from "react-native";

const supabaseUrl = process.env.EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL || "";
const supabaseKey = process.env.EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY || "";

const storage = Platform.OS === "web" ? undefined : AsyncStorage;

export const supabase = createClient(supabaseUrl, supabaseKey, {
  auth: {
    storage: storage,
    autoRefreshToken: true,
    persistSession: true,
    detectSessionInUrl: Platform.OS === "web",
  },
});
```

### 2. **Theme Provider**

The theme provider is implemented using `useColorScheme` from `react-native`:

```typescript
import { useColorScheme } from "react-native";

export const useTheme = () => {
  const theme = useColorScheme() ?? "light";
  return Colors[theme];
};
```

### 3. **Profile Update**

The profile update screen allows users to:

- Update their full name and date of birth.
- Upload a profile picture (supports images and GIFs).
